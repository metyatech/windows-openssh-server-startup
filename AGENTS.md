# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)
- Before starting any work, run `compose-agentsmd` from the project root.
- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, install it via npm: `npm install -g compose-agentsmd`.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes the rules workspace when `source` is GitHub (if the workspace is clean), then regenerates `AGENTS.md` with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

# Rule composition and maintenance

## Scope and composition

- AGENTS.md is self-contained; do not rely on parent/child AGENTS for inheritance or precedence.
- Maintain shared rules centrally and compose per project; use project-local rules only for truly local policies.
- Place AGENTS.md at the project root; only add another AGENTS.md for nested independent projects.

## Update policy

- Never edit AGENTS.md directly; update source rules and regenerate AGENTS.md.
- A request to "update rules" means: update the appropriate rule module and ruleset, then regenerate AGENTS.md.
- If the user gives a persistent instruction (e.g., "always", "must"), encode it in the appropriate module (global vs local).
- When acknowledging a new persistent instruction, update the rule module in the same change set and regenerate AGENTS.md.
- When creating a new repository, set up rule files (e.g., agent-ruleset.json and any local rules) so compose-agentsmd can run.
- When updating rules, infer the core intent; if it is a global policy, record it in global rules rather than project-local rules.
- If a task requires domain rules not listed in agent-ruleset.json, update the ruleset to include them and regenerate AGENTS.md before proceeding.
- When rule changes produce a diff, include it in the final response unless the user explicitly asks to omit it.

## Editing standards

- Keep rules MECE, concise, and non-redundant.
- Use short, action-oriented bullets; avoid numbered lists unless order matters.
- Prefer the most general applicable rule to avoid duplication.
- Do not use numeric filename prefixes (e.g., `00-...`) to impose ordering; treat rule modules as a flat set. If ordering matters, encode it explicitly in composition/tooling rather than filenames.

## Rule placement (global vs domain)

- Decide rule placement based on **where the rule is needed**, not what topic it covers.
- If the rule could be needed from any workspace or repository, make it global.
- Only use domain rules when the rule is strictly relevant inside repositories that opt in to that domain.
- Before choosing domain, verify: "Will this rule ever be needed when working from a workspace that does not include this domain?" If yes, make it global.

# Autonomous operations

- Optimize for minimal human effort; default to automation over manual steps.
- Drive work from the desired outcome: choose the highest-quality safe path that satisfies the requested quality/ideal bar, and execute end-to-end.
- Treat speed as a secondary optimization; never trade down correctness, safety, robustness, or verifiability unless the requester explicitly approves that tradeoff.
- Assume end-to-end autonomy for repository operations (issue triage, PRs, direct pushes to main/master, merges, releases, repo admin) only within repositories under the user's control (e.g., owned by metyatech or where the user has explicit maintainer/push authority), unless the user restricts scope; for third-party repos, require explicit user request before any of these operations.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless explicitly requested; avoid legacy aliases and compatibility shims by default.
- When work reveals rule gaps, redundancy, or misplacement, proactively update rule modules/rulesets (including moves/renames) and regenerate AGENTS.md without waiting for explicit user requests.
- After each task, briefly assess whether avoidable mistakes occurred. In direct mode, propose rule updates if warranted. In delegated mode, include improvement suggestions in the task result.
- If you state a persistent workflow change (e.g., `from now on`, `I'll always`), immediately propose the corresponding rule update and request approval in the same task; do not leave it as an unrecorded promise. When operating under a multi-agent-delegation model, follow that rule module's guidance on restricted operations before proposing changes.
- Because session memory resets between tasks, treat rule files as persistent memory; when any issue or avoidable mistake occurs, update rules in the same task to prevent recurrence.
- Treat these rules as the source of truth; do not override them with repository conventions. If a repo conflicts, update the repo to comply or update the rules to encode the exception; do not make undocumented exceptions.
- When something is unclear, investigate to resolve it; do not proceed with unresolved material uncertainty. If still unclear, ask and include what you checked.
- Do not proceed based on assumptions or guesses without explicit user approval; hypotheses may be discussed but must not drive action.
- Make decisions explicit when they affect scope, risk, cost, or irreversibility.
- Prefer asynchronous, low-friction control channels (GitHub Issues/PR comments) unless a repository mandates another.
- Design autonomous workflows for high volume: queue requests, set concurrency limits, and auto-throttle to prevent overload.

Source: github:metyatech/agent-rules@HEAD/rules/global/cli-standards.md

# CLI standards

- Provide --help/-h with clear usage, options, and examples; include required parameters in examples.
- Provide --version (use -V); reserve -v for --verbose.
- Support stdin/stdout piping; allow output redirection (e.g., --output for file creation).
- Offer machine-readable output (e.g., --json) when emitting structured data.
- For modifying/deleting actions, provide --dry-run and an explicit bypass (--yes/--force).
- Provide controllable logging (--quiet, --verbose, or --trace).
- Use deterministic exit codes (0 success, non-zero failure) and avoid silent fallbacks.
- For JSON configuration, define/update a JSON Schema and validate config on load.
- For interactive CLI prompts, provide required context before asking; for yes/no prompts, Enter means "Yes" and "n" means "No".

Source: github:metyatech/agent-rules@HEAD/rules/global/command-execution.md

# Workflow and command execution

- Do not add wrappers or pipes to commands unless the user explicitly asks.
- Prefer repository-standard scripts/commands (package.json scripts, README instructions).
- Reproduce reported command issues by running the same command (or closest equivalent) before proposing fixes.
- Avoid interactive git prompts by using --no-edit or setting GIT_EDITOR=true.
- If elevated privileges are required, use sudo where available; otherwise run as Administrator.
- Keep changes scoped to affected repositories; when shared modules change, update consumers and verify at least one.
- If no branch is specified, work on the current branch; direct commits to main/master are allowed.
- After addressing PR review feedback, resolve the corresponding review thread(s) before concluding; if you lack permission, state it explicitly.
- Before re-requesting review after addressing feedback, run the relevant verification suite and summarize results (commands + outcomes) in the PR comment/description.
- After pushing fixes for PR review feedback, re-request review only from reviewer(s) who posted the addressed feedback in the current round.
- Do not re-request review from reviewers (including AI reviewers) who did not post addressed feedback, or who already indicated no actionable issues.
- If no applicable reviewer remains, ask who should review next.
- When Codex and/or Copilot review bots are configured for the repo, trigger re-review only for the bot(s) that posted addressed feedback.
- For Codex re-review (only when applicable): comment `@codex review` on the PR.
- For Copilot re-review (only when applicable): use `gh api` to remove+re-request the bot reviewer `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` (do not rely on `gh pr edit --add-reviewer Copilot`).
  - Remove: `gh api --method DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/requested_reviewers -f "reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]"`
  - Add: `gh api --method POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/requested_reviewers -f "reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]"`
- After completing a PR, merge it, sync the target branch, and delete the PR branch locally and remotely.
- Agent platforms have different execution capabilities (sandboxing, network access, push permissions). Do not assume capabilities beyond what the current platform provides; fail explicitly when a required capability is unavailable.
- When handling GitHub notifications, use `DELETE /notifications/threads/{id}` (HTTP 204) to mark them as **done** (removes from inbox/moves to Done tab). Do NOT use `PATCH /notifications/threads/{id}` (marks as read but leaves in inbox). After processing notifications, bulk-delete any remaining read-but-not-done notifications with the same DELETE API.

# Delivery hard gates

These are non-negotiable completion gates for any state-changing work and for any response that claims "done", "fixed", "working", or "passing".

## Acceptance criteria (AC)

- Before state-changing work, list Acceptance Criteria (AC) as binary, testable statements.
- For read-only tasks, AC may be deliverables/questions answered; keep them checkable.
- If AC are ambiguous or not testable, ask blocking questions before proceeding.
- Keep AC compact by default (aim: 1-3 items). Expand only when risk/complexity demands it or when the requester asks.

## Evidence and verification

- For each AC, define verification evidence (automated test preferred; otherwise a deterministic manual procedure).
- Maintain an explicit mapping: `AC -> evidence (tests/commands/manual steps)`.
- The mapping may be presented in a compact per-item form (one line per AC including evidence + outcome) to reduce verbosity.
- For code or runtime-behavior changes, automated tests are required unless the requester explicitly approves skipping.
- Bugfixes MUST include a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after.
- Run the repo's full verification suite (lint/format/typecheck/test/build) using a single repo-standard `verify` command when available; if missing, add it.
- Enforce verification locally via commit-time hooks (pre-commit or repo-native) and in CI; skipping requires explicit requester approval.
- For non-code changes, run the relevant subset and justify.
- If required checks cannot be run, stop and ask for explicit approval to proceed with partial verification, and provide an exact manual verification plan.

## Final response (MUST include)

- A compact goal+verification report. Labels may be `Goal`/`Verification` instead of `AC` as long as it is equivalent.
- `AC -> evidence` mapping with outcomes (PASS/FAIL/NOT RUN/N/A), possibly in compact per-item form.
- The exact verification commands executed and their outcomes.

Source: github:metyatech/agent-rules@HEAD/rules/global/implementation-and-coding-standards.md

# Engineering and implementation standards

- Prefer official/standard approaches recommended by the framework or tooling.
- Prefer well-maintained external dependencies; build in-house only when no suitable option exists.
- Prefer third-party tools/services over custom implementations when they can meet the requirements; prefer free options (OSS/free-tier) when feasible and call out limitations/tradeoffs.
- PowerShell: `\` is a literal character (not an escape). Do not cargo-cult `\\` escaping patterns from other languages; validate APIs that require names like `Local\...` (e.g., named mutexes).
- PowerShell: avoid assigning to or shadowing automatic/read-only variables (e.g., `$args`, `$PID`); use different names for locals.
- PowerShell: when invoking PowerShell from PowerShell, avoid double-quoted `-Command` strings that allow the outer shell to expand `$...`; prefer `-File`, single quotes, or here-strings to control expansion.
- If functionality appears reusable, assess reuse first and propose a shared module/repo; prefer remote dependencies (never local filesystem paths).
- Maintainability > testability > extensibility > readability.
- Single responsibility; keep modules narrowly scoped and prefer composition over inheritance.
- Keep dependency direction clean and swappable; avoid global mutable state.
- Avoid deep nesting; use guard clauses and small functions.
- Use clear, intention-revealing naming; avoid "Utils" dumping grounds.
- Prefer configuration/constants over hardcoding; consolidate change points.
- For GUI changes, prioritize ergonomics and discoverability so first-time users can complete core flows without external documents.
- Every user-facing GUI component (inputs, actions, status indicators, lists, and dialog controls) must include an in-app explanation (for example tooltip, context help panel, or equivalent).
- Do not rely on README-only guidance for GUI operation; critical usage guidance must be available inside the GUI itself.
- For GUI styling, prefer frameworks and component libraries that provide a modern, polished appearance out of the box (e.g., Material Design, shadcn/ui, Fluent); avoid hand-crafting extensive custom styles when an established design system can achieve the same result with less effort.
- When selecting a UI framework, prioritize built-in component quality and default aesthetics over raw flexibility; the goal is a standard, modern-looking UI with minimal custom styling code.
- Keep everything DRY across code, specs, docs, tests, configs, and scripts; proactively refactor repeated procedures into shared configs/scripts with small, local overrides.
- Persist durable runtime/domain data in a database with a fully normalized schema (3NF/BCNF target): store each fact once with keys/constraints, and compute derived statuses/views at read time instead of duplicating them.
- Fix root causes; remove obsolete/unused code, branches, comments, and helpers.
- Avoid leaving half-created state on failure paths. Any code that allocates/registers/starts resources must have a shared teardown that runs on all failure and cancellation paths.
- Do not block inside async APIs or async-looking code paths; avoid synchronous I/O and synchronous process execution where responsiveness is expected.
- Avoid external command execution (PATH-dependent tools, stringly-typed argument concatenation). Prefer native libraries/SDKs. If unavoidable: use absolute paths, safe argument handling, and strict input validation.
- Prefer stable public APIs over internal/private APIs. If internal/private APIs are unavoidable, isolate them and document the reason and the expected break risk.
- Externalize large embedded strings/templates/rules when possible.
- Do not commit build artifacts (follow the repo's .gitignore).
- Align file/folder names with their contents and keep naming conventions consistent.
- Do not assume machine-specific environments (fixed workspace directories, drive letters, per-PC paths). Prefer repo-relative paths and explicit configuration so workflows work in arbitrary clone locations.
- Temporary files/directories created by the agent MUST be placed only under the OS temp directory (e.g., `%TEMP%` / `$env:TEMP`). Do not create ad-hoc temp folders in repos/workspaces unless the requester explicitly approves.

Source: github:metyatech/agent-rules@HEAD/rules/global/linting-formatting-and-static-analysis.md

# Linters, formatters, and static analysis

## General policy

- Every code repo must have a formatter and a linter/static analyzer for its primary languages.
- Prefer one formatter and one linter per language; avoid overlapping tools that fight each other.
- Follow the standard toolchains below. If a repo conflicts, migrate it to comply unless the user explicitly restricts scope.
- If you believe an exception is needed, encode it as a rule update and regenerate AGENTS.md before proceeding.
- Enforce in CI: run formatting checks (verify-no-changes) and linting on pull requests and require them for merges.
- Treat warnings as errors in CI; when a tool cannot, use its strictest available setting so warnings fail CI.
- Do not disable rules globally; keep suppressions narrow, justified, and time-bounded.
- Pin tool versions (lockfiles/manifests) for reproducible CI.

## Design and visual accessibility automation

- Apply this section to projects with web UI components only.
- For any design/UI styling change in any project, enforce automated visual accessibility checks as part of the repo-standard `verify` command and CI.
- Do not rely on per-page/manual test maintenance; use route discovery (for example sitemap, generated route lists, or framework route manifests) so newly added pages are automatically included.
- Validate both light and dark themes when theme switching is supported.
- Validate at least default, hover, and focus states for interactive elements.
- Enforce non-text boundary contrast checks across all visible UI elements that present boundaries (including interactive controls and container-like elements), not only predefined component classes.
- Do not hardcode a narrow selector allowlist for boundary checks; use broad DOM discovery with only minimal technical exclusions (for example hidden/zero-size/non-rendered nodes).
- Fail CI on violations; do not silently ignore design regressions.
- If temporary exclusions are unavoidable, keep them narrowly scoped, documented with rationale, and remove them promptly.

## Security baseline

- Require dependency vulnerability scanning appropriate to the ecosystem (SCA) for merges. If you cannot enable it, report the limitation and get explicit user approval before proceeding without it.
- Enable GitHub secret scanning and remediate findings; never commit secrets. If it is unavailable, add a repo-local secret scanner and require it for merges.
- Enable CodeQL code scanning for supported languages. If it cannot be enabled, report the limitation and use the best available alternative for that ecosystem.

## Default toolchain by language

### JavaScript / TypeScript (incl. React/Next)

- Format+lint: ESLint + Prettier.
- When configuring Prettier, always add and maintain `.prettierignore` so generated/build outputs and composed files are not formatted/linted as source (e.g., `dist/`, build artifacts, and `AGENTS.md` when generated by compose-agentsmd).
- Typecheck: `tsc` with strict settings for TS projects.
- Dependency scan: `osv-scanner`. If unsupported, use the package manager's audit tooling.

### Python

- Format+lint: Ruff.
- Typecheck: Pyright.
- Dependency scan: pip-audit.

### Go

- Format: gofmt.
- Lint/static analysis: golangci-lint (includes staticcheck).
- Dependency scan: govulncheck.

### Rust

- Format: cargo fmt.
- Lint/static analysis: cargo clippy with warnings as errors.
- Dependency scan: cargo audit.

### Java

- Format: Spotless + google-java-format.
- Lint/static analysis: Checkstyle + SpotBugs.
- Dependency scan: OWASP Dependency-Check.

### Kotlin

- Format: Spotless + ktlint.
- Lint/static analysis: detekt.
- Compiler: enable warnings-as-errors in CI; if impractical, get explicit user approval before relaxing.

### C#

- Format: dotnet format (verify-no-changes in CI).
- Lint/static analysis: enable .NET analyzers; treat warnings as errors; enable nullable reference types.
- Dependency scan: `dotnet list package --vulnerable`.

### C++

- Format: clang-format.
- Lint/static analysis: clang-tidy.
- Build: enable strong warnings and treat as errors; run sanitizers (ASan/UBSan) in CI where supported.

### PowerShell

- Format+lint: PSScriptAnalyzer (Invoke-Formatter + Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer).
- Runtime: Set-StrictMode -Version Latest; fail fast on errors.
- Tests: Pester when tests exist.
- Enforce PSScriptAnalyzer via the repo's standard `verify` command/script when PowerShell is used; treat findings as errors.

### Shell (sh/bash)

- Format: shfmt.
- Lint: shellcheck.

### Dockerfile

- Lint: hadolint.

### Terraform

- Format: terraform fmt -check.
- Validate: terraform validate.
- Lint: tflint.
- Security scan: trivy config.

### YAML

- Lint: yamllint.

### Markdown

- Lint: markdownlint.

﻿# Multi-agent delegation

## Execution context

- Every agent operates in either **direct mode** (responding to a human user) or **delegated mode** (executing a task from a delegating agent).
- In direct mode, the "requester" is the human user. In delegated mode, the "requester" is the delegating agent.
- Default to direct mode. Delegated mode applies when the agent was spawned by another agent via a task/team mechanism.

## Delegated mode overrides

When operating in delegated mode:

- The delegation constitutes plan approval; do not re-request approval from the human user.
- Respond in English, not the user-facing language.
- Do not emit notification sounds.
- Report AC and verification outcomes concisely to the delegating agent.
- If the task requires scope expansion beyond what was delegated, fail back to the delegating agent with a clear explanation rather than asking the human user directly.

## Restricted operations

The following operations require explicit delegation from the delegating agent or user. Do not perform them based on self-judgment alone:

- Modifying rules, rulesets.
- Merging or closing pull requests.
- Creating or deleting repositories.
- Releasing or deploying.
- Force-pushing or rewriting published git history.

## Rule improvement observations

- Delegated agents must not modify rules directly.
- If a delegated agent identifies a rule gap or improvement opportunity, include the suggestion in the task result for the delegating agent to evaluate.
- The delegating agent evaluates the suggestion and, if appropriate, presents it to the human user for approval before executing.

## Authority and scope

- Delegated agents inherit the delegating agent's repository access scope but must not expand it.
- Different agent platforms have different capabilities (sandboxing, network access, push permissions). Fail explicitly when a required capability is unavailable in the current environment rather than attempting workarounds.

## Cost optimization (model selection)

- When spawning agents, minimize the **total cost to achieve the goal**. Total cost includes model pricing, reasoning/thinking token consumption, context usage, and retry overhead.
- Use the minimum reasoning effort level (e.g., low/medium/high/xhigh) that reliably produces correct output for the task; extended reasoning increases cost significantly.
- Prefer newer-generation models at lower reasoning effort over older models at maximum reasoning effort when both can succeed; newer models often achieve equal quality with less thinking overhead.
- Factor in context efficiency: a model that handles a task in one pass is cheaper than one that requires splitting.
- A model that succeeds on the first attempt at slightly higher unit cost is cheaper overall than one that requires retries.

## Parallel execution safety

- Do not run multiple agents that modify the same files or repository concurrently.
- Independent tasks across different repositories may run in parallel.
- If two tasks target the same repository, assess conflict risk: non-overlapping files may run in parallel; overlapping files must run sequentially.
- When in doubt, run sequentially to avoid merge conflicts and inconsistent state.

Source: github:metyatech/agent-rules@HEAD/rules/global/planning-and-approval-gate.md

# Planning and approval gate

- Default to a two-phase workflow: clarify goal + plan first, execute after explicit requester approval.
- In delegated mode (see Multi-agent delegation), the delegation itself constitutes plan approval. Do not re-request approval from the human user. If scope expansion is needed, fail back to the delegating agent.
- If a request may require any state-changing work, you MUST first dialogue with the requester to clarify details and make the goal explicit. Do not proceed while the goal is ambiguous.
- Allowed before approval:
  - Clarifying questions and read-only inspection (reading files, searching, and `git status` / `git diff` / `git log`).
  - Any unavoidable automated work triggered as a side-effect of those read-only commands.
  - Any command execution that must not adversely affect program behavior or external systems (including changes made by tooling), such as:
    - Installing/restoring dependencies using repo-standard tooling (lockfile changes are allowed).
    - Running formatters/linters/typecheck/tests/builds (including auto-fix/formatting that modifies files).
    - Running code generation/build steps that are deterministic and repo-scoped.
    - Running these from clean → dirty → clean is acceptable; publishing/deploying/migrating is not.
- Before any other state-changing execution (e.g., writing or modifying files by hand, changing runtime behavior, or running git commands beyond status/diff/log), do all of the following:
  - Restate the request as Acceptance Criteria (AC) and verification methods, following "Delivery hard gates" (keep concise by default).
  - Produce a written plan (use your planning tool when available) focused on the goal, approach, and verification checkpoints (keep concise by default; do not enumerate per-file implementation details or exact commands unless the requester asks).
  - Confirm the plan with the requester, ask for approval explicitly, and wait for a clear "yes" before executing.
  - Once the requester has approved a plan, proceed within that plan without re-requesting approval; re-request approval only when you change or expand the plan.
  - Do not treat the original task request as plan approval; approval must be an explicit response to the presented plan.
- If state-changing execution starts without the required post-plan "yes", stop immediately, report the gate miss, add/update a prevention rule, regenerate AGENTS.md, and then restart from the approval gate.
- No other exceptions: even if the user requests immediate execution (e.g., "skip planning", "just do it"), treat that as a request to move quickly through this gate, not to bypass it.

Source: github:metyatech/agent-rules@HEAD/rules/global/quality-testing-and-errors.md

# Quality, testing, and error handling

For AC definition, verification evidence, regression tests, and final reporting requirements, see Delivery hard gates.

## Quality priority

- Quality (correctness, safety, robustness, verifiability) takes priority over speed or convenience.

## Verification

- If you are unsure what constitutes the full suite, run the repo's default verify/CI commands rather than guessing.
- Enforce via CI: run the full suite on pull requests and on pushes to the default branch, and make it a required status check for merges; if no CI harness exists, add one using repo-standard commands.
- Configure required status checks on the default branch when you have permission; otherwise report the limitation.
- Do not rely on smoke-only gating or scheduled-only full runs for correctness; merges must require the full suite.
- Ensure commit-time automation (pre-commit or repo-native) runs the full suite and blocks commits.
- Never disable checks, weaken assertions, loosen types, or add retries solely to make checks pass.
- If the execution environment restricts test execution (no network, no database, sandboxed), run the available subset, document what was skipped, and ensure CI covers the remainder.

## Tests (behavior changes)

- Follow test-first: add/update tests, observe failure, implement the fix, then observe pass.
- Cover success, failure, boundary, invalid input, and key state transitions (including first-run/cold-start vs subsequent-run behavior when relevant); include representative concurrency/retry/recovery when relevant.
- Keep tests deterministic; minimize time/random/external I/O; inject when needed.
- For deterministic output files, use full-content snapshot/golden tests.
- Prefer making nondeterministic failures reproducible over adding sleeps/retries; do not mask flakiness.
- For timing/order/race issues, prefer deterministic synchronization (events, versioned state, acks/handshakes) over fixed sleeps.
- If a heuristic wait is unavoidable, it MUST be condition-based with a hard deadline and diagnostics, and requires explicit requester approval.
- For integration boundaries (network/DB/external services/UI flows), add an integration/E2E/contract test that exercises the boundary; avoid unit-only coverage for integration bugs.
- For non-trivial changes, create a small test matrix (scenarios × inputs × states) and cover the highest-risk combinations; document intentional gaps.

## Feedback loops and root causes

- Treat time-to-detect and time-to-fix as quality attributes; shorten the feedback loop with automation and observability rather than relying on manual QA.
- For any defect fix or incident remediation, perform a brief root-cause classification: implementation mistake, design deficit, and/or ambiguous/incorrect requirements.
- Feed the root cause upstream in the same change set: add or tighten tests/checks/alerts, update specs/acceptance criteria, and update design docs/ADRs when applicable.
- If the failure should have been detected earlier, add a gate at the earliest reliable point (lint/typecheck/tests/CI required checks or runtime alerts/health checks); skipping this requires explicit user approval.
- Record the prevention mechanism (what will catch it next time) in the PR description or issue comment; avoid "fixed" without a concrete feedback-loop improvement.

## Exceptions

- If required tests are impractical, document the coverage gap, provide a manual verification plan, and get explicit user approval before skipping.

## Error handling and validation

- Never swallow errors; fail fast or return early with explicit errors.
- Error messages must reflect actual state and include relevant input context.
- Validate config and external inputs at boundaries; fail with actionable guidance.
- Log minimally but with diagnostic context; never log secrets or personal data.
- Remove temporary debugging/instrumentation before the final patch.

# Release and publication

## Packaging and distribution

- Include LICENSE in published artifacts (copyright holder: metyatech).
- Do not ship build/test artifacts or local configs; ensure a clean environment can use the product via README steps.
- Define a SemVer policy and document what counts as a breaking change.

## Public repository metadata

- For public repos, set GitHub Description, Topics, and Homepage.
- Ensure required repo files exist: .github/workflows/ci.yml, issue templates, PR template, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CHANGELOG.md.
- Configure CI to run the repo's standard lint/test/build commands.

## Versioning and release flow

- Update version metadata when release content changes; keep package version and Git tag consistent.
- Create and push a release tag; create a GitHub Release based on CHANGELOG.
- If asked to choose a version, decide it yourself.
- When bumping a version, create the GitHub Release and publish the package in the same update.
- For npm publishing, ask the user to run npm publish (do not execute it directly).
- Before publishing, run required prep commands (e.g., npm install, npm test, npm pack --dry-run) and only proceed when ready.
- If authentication fails during publish, ask the user to complete the publish step.
- Run dependency security checks before release, address critical issues, and report results.
- After publishing, update any locally installed copy to the newly published release and verify the resolved version.
  - Completion gate: do not report “done” until this verification is completed (or the user explicitly declines).
  - Must be expressed as explicit Acceptance Criteria and reported with outcomes (PASS/FAIL/N/A) + evidence in the final report:
    - AC1 (registry): verify the published version exists in the registry (e.g., `npm view <pkg> version`).
    - AC2 (fresh install): verify the latest package resolves and runs (e.g., `npx <pkg>@latest --version`).
    - AC3 (global update, if applicable): if the package is installed globally, update it to the published version and verify (e.g., `npm ls -g <pkg> --depth=0`, `npm i -g <pkg>@latest`, then `<cmd> --version`).
    - If AC3 is not applicable (not installed globally) or cannot be performed, mark it N/A and state the reason explicitly.
  - For npm CLIs:
    - If installed globally: check `npm ls -g <pkg> --depth=0`, update via `npm i -g <pkg>@latest` (or the published dist-tag), then verify with `<pkg> --version`.
    - If not installed globally: skip the global update, and verify availability via `npx <pkg>@latest --version` (or the ecosystem-equivalent).

## Published artifact requirements

- Populate package metadata (name, description, repository, issues, homepage, engines).
- Validate executable entrypoints and required shebangs so installed commands work.
- If a repo represents a single tool/product, publish a single package (bundle related scripts).

Source: github:metyatech/agent-rules@HEAD/rules/global/skill-authoring.md

# Skill authoring standards

## SKILL.md format (Agent Skills open standard)

- Follow the Agent Skills open standard (agentskills.io/specification).
- SKILL.md frontmatter must contain only `name` and `description`; do not add platform-specific fields.
- `name`: lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only, max 64 characters.
- `description`: explain when the skill should and should not trigger; this is the only text used for skill selection.

## Platform independence

- SKILL.md body must be platform-agnostic: do not reference platform-specific tool names
  (e.g., `Task`, `TeamCreate`, `codex exec`, Cursor-specific APIs).
- Write instructions in terms of intent ("launch a background agent", "track tasks",
  "create a team") and let each agent use its own tools.
- Platform-specific invocation examples (`/skill` for Claude Code, `$skill` for Codex)
  belong in README.md, not in SKILL.md.

## Distribution

- Each skill lives in its own repository.
- Use clear, descriptive repository names (e.g., `skill-manager`).
- Keep SKILL.md at the repository root for `npx skills add` compatibility.
- Install and manage skills via `npx skills add <owner>/<repo>` (vercel-labs/skills);
  do not build custom installers.

## Publishing

- Default to public repositories so skills are installable by anyone
  via `npx skills add`.
- Write SKILL.md and README.md with external users in mind:
  assume no prior knowledge of internal conventions.
- Include a LICENSE file (prefer MIT).

## Content guidelines

- Write SKILL.md body and README.md in English (developer-facing).
- Keep instructions concise, action-oriented, and testable.
- Do not duplicate rules already covered by AGENTS.md global rules
  (e.g., TDD, verification, planning gates); reference them instead.

# User identity and accounts

- The user's name is "metyatech".
- Any external reference using "metyatech" (GitHub org/user, npm scope, repos) is under the user's control.
- The user has GitHub and npm accounts.
- Use the gh CLI to verify GitHub details when needed.
- When publishing, cloning, adding submodules, or splitting repos, prefer the user's "metyatech" ownership unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

# Writing and documentation

## User responses

- Respond in Japanese unless the user requests otherwise.
- Always report whether you committed and whether you pushed; include repo(s), branch(es), and commit hash(es) when applicable.
- After completing a response, emit the Windows SystemSounds.Asterisk sound via PowerShell when possible.

## Developer-facing writing

- Write developer documentation, code comments, and commit messages in English.
- Rule modules are written in English.

## README and docs

- Every repository must include README.md covering overview/purpose, supported environments/compatibility, install/setup, usage examples, dev commands (build/test/lint/format), required env/config, release/deploy steps if applicable, and links to SECURITY.md / CONTRIBUTING.md / LICENSE / CHANGELOG.md when they exist.
- For any change, assess documentation impact and update all affected docs in the same change set so docs match behavior (README, docs/, examples, comments, templates, ADRs/specs, diagrams).
- If no documentation updates are needed, explain why in the final response.
- For CLIs, document every parameter (required and optional) with a description and at least one example; also include at least one end-to-end example command.
- Do not include user-specific local paths, fixed workspace directories, drive letters, or personal data in doc examples. Prefer repo-relative paths and placeholders so instructions work in arbitrary environments.

## Markdown linking

- When a Markdown document links to a local file, use a path relative to the Markdown file.
